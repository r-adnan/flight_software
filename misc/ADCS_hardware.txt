"Figure out how you are oriented in inertial space and then point to where you want to be."

Fundamental Modes:
    Detumble
        Reduce ngular rates
    Single axis pointing
        Point solar panels at sun
        Align instrument with magnetic field vector
    Fully-determined attitude
        Point communications antenna at ground site
        Point optics at specified target
        Local-vertical/local-horizontal (LVLH) hold (e.g. nadir)

Sensors:
    Magnetometer
        Senses local magnetic field Typically an integrated three-axis MEMS package that reports field strength along each sense axis
        Can be damaged by exposure to excessive fields
        Can pick up residual fields from various components as well as dynamic fields such as reaction wheel motors
            Require phasing with magnetorquers to avoid magnetorquer field dominating measurements
    Gyroscope
        Senses angular rates
            Can be purchased as integrated three-axis packages or discrete single-axis componentsPrimary specifications are noise, bias, angular random walk
            Can be quite sensitive to temperature chnges or mechanical stress
        Fundamental technology are MEMS, fiber-optic, and ring-laser
            Cubesats are typically MEMS, some smallsats use FOGs
                MEMS are low space/weight/power (SWaP) and cheap
            MEMS are quite noisy and drift relatively quickly, this impacts attitude filter design
                A lot of academic papers assume FOG- or RLG-level perofrmance in their simulations
                Can buy your way out of some of this
        Can have large implications for simulation and model fidelity
            Farrenkopf's approximation is just noise and bias, MEMS gyros likely require modelling of bias drift for meaningful assessment
    Sun Sensors
        Many varieties exist
            Discrete photodiodes: Simple intensity, are combined at the subsystem level to form an estimated sun vector
            Photodiode pyramid: Differential intensities on the faces of the pyramid estimate a pointing error
            Integrated IC: Report X/Y angles of the incident light source
            Image Sensor: Project light source onto an image sensor to produce a vector
        Accuracy ranges from approx. 0.5 degrees (image sensor) to pprox 5 deg (photodiodes)
        Need some other sensor (or allow drift) while in eclipse
    Star Trackers
        Takes a picture of the star field and references to internal database to determine what part of the sky t is looking at Image provides both direction to identified centroid and rotation about that vector, rotation is less accurate
        Approx 5 arc-sec cross-boresight and approx. 15 arc-sec roll accuracy (at star tracker unit level) achievable in cubesat hardware
            System level accuracy worse
        Sensitive to stray light so require a baffle and/or large leepouts around any bright object
            More complex algoritms provides some resilience
        Sensitive to vehicle rotation s excess rotation smears stars, educing accuracy and eventually breaking the algorithm,
            Some use optical-flow algorithms to procide rate information
        Some systems use two star trackers (oriented 90 deg apart)
            Allows correction of reduces accuracy in roll   Higher availability (one star tracker can track while the other is blinded)
            Adds filter complexity to acoid jitter from switchover
        Introduce AIT handling considerations (cleanliness)
    GPSR
        The GPS receiver is also an important part of the ADCS  
            site-trackign requires the satellite know where it ispointing is time-sensitiveinternal models (e.g. magnetic field) require absolute tim
            Reuquirements take some trackign    
                Site-track angular error from a 1km position error is 0.15 detg
                Important position/time tie as a 1km dfirect position error is also an approx 130ms timing rerror, ADCS may require the PPS edge to synchronize data

Actuators
    Passive Magnetics
        Permanent magnet that wants to align with Earth's magnetic field (e.g. compass needle)
            Also need some material that exhibits magnetic hystersis to provide damping of oscillations about the magnetic field vecto
        Applies an external torque so does change net system angular momentum
        Provide coarse \
    Torque Coils/rods   
        Electromagnets that interact with Earth's megnatic field to produce a torque
            Typically three on orthogonl axes to provide full coverage
        Same Fundamenta \
    Reaction Wheels
        Generate torque by changing speed of a flywheel
            Acceolerating the flywheel one direction accelerates the vehicle the opposite directio
        Typically biased away from zero speed   
            Reaction wheel failure mode is typically bearing failure at zero speed crossings
        Internal torque so no change on net sytem angular momentum
            Will eventually "Saturate" is compensating for an external torque, requiers some means (e.g. torque rods) to produce an external torque frot he weheels to torque against to reduce flywheel spee
        Three orthogonal reaction wheels provide full coverage, four allows redundancy as well as nonzero speed zero-net-momentum confuigurations for hggher agility
    Control Moment Gyros 
        Generate torque by gimballing a flywheel    
            Changing the spin axis and therefore the angular momentum vector, of the flywheel produces a gyroscopic torque 
            Saturation behavior is alignment of all CMG axes 
        Highest control authority of any acutator but also most complicated 
            Very few smallsat-scale options exist 
        Conventional CMGs maintain a fixed flywheel speed \
    Thrusters
        While it is technically possible to use thrusters for attitude control (assuming appropriate placement) this is not recommended
            Current stae of smallsat thrusters is not great for tat level of reliability
            Limited mission life due to propellant usage 
            Relatively coarse control since min impulse bit may be a large and firing-to-firing consistency may be poor
            Even large spacecrat only use ADCS thrusters fro momentum management and stick with reaction wheels for primary control
