This system will need the following CFS applications:

    (initial system covers these):
    sch → to send scheduled messages to other applications
    ci → to receive user commands from the ground system
    to → to send out telemetry to the ground system
    io_lib → library used by CI and TO

    +specific ADCS stuff, possibly:
        starTracker_io → to read and publish startracker data
        gyros
        accelerometer
        torque rods

        Main task: star tracker
        child tasks:
            gyros
            accelerometer
            torque rods
        
Hardware servicing API:
    3 functions:
        1. performs necessary hardware configuration and initialization
        2. runs within ISR context whenever there is an interrupt generated by the hardware
        3. processing task; allowed full use of other cFE Service APIs
